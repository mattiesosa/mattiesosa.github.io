## Welcome to Mattie Soghikian's Webpage!

## This is a page where I'll share some information about myself and the work I am doing in BioInformatics. So far I've done some work to analyze data on penguins, as well as honey bee colony loss in the United States.

I am a senior undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Biology with a minor in psychology at Southern New Hampshire University. In my free time I love to practice yoga, hike with my two dogs (Maverick and Summit), listen to music and read. My goal for this website is to have a professional and organized layout of all my coding projects so they are easily accessible.

## Work with Penguins
I started learning how to use R by working with the Palmer Penquins data set. We ran an analysis using a small subset of 44 penguins. If you are interested, you can see my analysis [here](https://mattiesosa.github.io/BioStatisticsAnalysis/PalmerPenguinsAnalysis.html).

## Exploratory Analysis on Honey Bees
I began an exploratory analysis on the data set given on GitHub to create visual representation of how the time of year correlates with honey bee colony loss in different states thoughout the US. If you are interested, you can see my analysis [here](https://mattiesosa.github.io/BioStatisticsAnalysis/BeeColonyLossAnalysis.html).

## Finding the Replication Origin
For this project I went deeper into bioinformatics and learned more difficult code. I completed a number of challenges where I learned how to create and implement functions like the for loop. If you are interested, you can see my project
[here](https://agmath.github.io/BIO4ST1_Group2/Replication_Mattie_Soghikian.html).

## Exploratory Analysis on Volcano Eruptions
This is an unfinished exploratory analysis on the volcano eruptions data set I pulled from Github. If you are interested, you can see my unfinished project
[here](http://mattiesosa.github.io/BioStatisticsAnalysis/VolcanoEruptionsAnalysis.html).
